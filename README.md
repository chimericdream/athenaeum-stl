# Athenaeum STL Library Manager

This project is a work in progress. Documentation coming soon.

## tl;dr

* Rust + SQLite backend
* Next.js frontend
* Automatically import models from a specified directory
* Models can have multiple part files (e.g. `stl`, `obj`, etc), images, projects (e.g. `3mf`, `scad`, etc), and support files (e.g. `zip`, `txt`, etc)
* Models can be tagged with arbitrary labels for easy organization and searching
* Part files can be previewed in the browser using Three.js

## Planned features

* So, so many things
* Real docs
* Website/demo
